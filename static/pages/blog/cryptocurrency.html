	<p>So recently I cloned the bitcoin source code since its open source. Link to which can be found <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">here</a>. I made a few alterations to some of the aspects of bitcoin, such as the block reward, network port and the halving intervals, and made it my own. I now have a completely independant blockchain running on a network of a few computers, where people can annonymously and privately join and leave the network as they please, they may also transfer coins between themselves and they even have the power to create new coins for themselves through the process of mining.</p><br>

	<p>The code can be downloaded <a class="tangerine" href="http://download.lucidcoin.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. So far I only have the wallet compiled for windows and linux, but I hope to make it available for more platforms in the near future. </p><br>
