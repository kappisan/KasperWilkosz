	<h2 class="work-title honeysuckle">JS</h2>

	<p>JavaScript is definitely my programming language of choice and is easily the language I have the most experience in. JS is arguably the most open programming language there is: ECMA-262, its specification, is an ISO standard. With a massive amount of open source libraries to do pretty much anything and the limitless potential of the web it is by far the best language to know. Below is an example of D3, a popular library allowing data to be plotted inside HTML's native SVG or Canvas elements.</p><br>

	<h2 class="work-title honeysuckle">CSS3</h2>
	<p>In recent years CSS has become a very powerful language. Transitions and animations applied to elements, gradually changing from one style to another creates a smooth user experience. CSS could be used to slightly change the size and color of a button on hover, or to fade in a page on load, or even to rotate the loading spinner while the page is loading. Below is a HTML element animated in CSS with multiple keyframe transitions.</p>

	<h2 class="work-title honeysuckle">HTML</h2>

	<p>HTML makes up the content of webpages and the latest standard HTML5 contains tons of elements that you would need inside a webpage, ranging from inputs, buttons, svg, images, text, etc...</p>

	<p>Angular JS is a platform loved by millions that extends the functionality of HTMl to include conditional statements, templates, data binding, angular directives and much more. It is a platform I often use when developing web apps as it is very scalable and can handle huge data requirements and because it can significantly increase the speed of development.</p>
